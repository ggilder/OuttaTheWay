# OuttaTheWay!

A little Cocoa app I wrote for a Mac kiosk. Moves the cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen. You know, to get it... outta the way.

In my setup, I added this and Firefox to the Login Items in System Preferences. You have to check the box to hide this so that Firefox gets focus. I use the Full Fullscreen add-on for Firefox to have it start up in full screen mode.
